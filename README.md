# #Train Time#
This is a train timetable app.  When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
* Train Name
* Destination
* First Train Time -- in military time
* Frequency -- in minutes

The app will calculate, store and display this information. The app calculates when the next train will arrive; relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines can view same train times.

The User Interface is coded with the Materialize framework; moment.js is used for time calculations.
